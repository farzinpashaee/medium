# Spring Boot Kafka Integration

Without a doubt, the Stream was one of the major features added to Java 8. If you don't know what a stream is, a stream is a sequence of objects that support functional-style operations on elements, such as map-reduce transformations on collections with a pipeline approach.

Kafka combines three key capabilities so you can implement your use cases for event streaming end-to-end with a single battle-tested solution:

- To **publish** (write) and subscribe to (read) streams of events, including continuous import/export of your data from other systems.
- To **store** streams of events durably and reliably for as long as you want.
- To **process** streams of events as they occur or retrospectively.

## Spring Boot Example
